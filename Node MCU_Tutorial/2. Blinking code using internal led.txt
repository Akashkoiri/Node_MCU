void setup() {
  // your setup code here, run once:
  	pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);               // Defining that inbuilt board led 					    	    is an output device
} 

void loop() {
  // your main code here, run repeatedly:
  	digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH); 	 // command to switch on the led
  	delay(1000);		   	 // switch on for 1 second
  	digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);	 // command to switch off the led
	delay(1000);			 // switch off for 1 second
}


//Conclusion: It looks like blinking in a loop.....
