#define led D5  // defining a external led using variable with connected pin no.
void setup() {
  	pinMode(led, OUTPUT); // Defining that var led is an output device
} 

void loop() {
  	digitalWrite(led, HIGH); // command to switch on the led
  	delay(1000);		 // switch on for 1 second
  	digitalWrite(led, LOW);	 // command to switch off the led
	delay(1000);		 // switch off for 1 second
}


//Conclusion: It looks like blinking in a loop.....
